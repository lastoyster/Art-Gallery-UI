# Art-gallery
This is a re-built version of an art gallery app ui (created with React Native) with react native carousel.

## About
I wanted to test my React Native skill by building new app ui or improving existing app ui. This version has been completely re-built with a better code organization with clear separation of concerns - which makes the code much more readable & maintainable.
<br /><br />
In particular, the app was built with the latest the standards & conventions. All the mock data & element styling are now separated from the component logic. All integrated functions are refactored out from the components to make them less bloated. The old `<ScrollView />` was replaced with `<FlatList />` which loads content lazily to improve performance. A lot of unnecessary containers are removed from the code. As a result, a final JSX is much smaller and easier to read.

## Original app
